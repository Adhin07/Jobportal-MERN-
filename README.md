Job portal Web application
*************************
Job portal is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to provide a dynamic and responsive platform for job seekers and employers. Users can create profiles, search and apply for jobs, while employers can post job listings, review applications, and manage their recruitment processes. The website supports user authentication, job search filters. With an intuitive user interface and powerful backend, the platform streamlines the job application and hiring process.
